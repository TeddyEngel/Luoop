Luoop
=====

A lightweight and flexible object oriented library for Lua.

This is an implementation of a object-oriented Lua module, coded entirely in Lua.
It is meant to be simple and flexible, since the main requirement was to handle multiple inheritance and overloading + the ability
to call constructors / destructors with custom parameters.

Features
--------

* Object oriented
* Constructors / destructors
