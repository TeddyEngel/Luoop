Luoop
=====

An easy and flexible object oriented library for Lua.

This is an implementation of a object-oriented Lua module, coded entirely in Lua.
It is meant to be simple and flexile, since the main initial requirement was multiple inheritance and overloading + the ability
to call constructors / destructors with custom parameters.

Features
--------

* Object oriented
* Constructors / destructors
* Multiple inheritance
* Overloading
* new() method, to get a new instance of an existing object
* Ad-hoc constructor / destructor calling, allowing to pass specific parameters to each superclass constructor / destructor
* Consistent use of `:` recommended.

Note: Please check the `example` folder in the package to see how to use the library.

Warnings
--------

* The library might evolve in the future.
